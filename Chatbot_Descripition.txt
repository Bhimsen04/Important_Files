Agents  :-         Agent name :- e.g CustomerCareChatbot (Agent created)
				   All things comes under agent :- 1)Intents 2)Training 3)Integrations
Intents :-         1)default Welcome Intent 2)ask a question 3)book a flight ticket
				   We have "default Welcome Intent" they have training phrase like hello,hi,hey......etc
				   Intention of the user like user have intention of asking a question or anything else e.g "ask a question".
				   User can ask in multiple ways same question thats why add multiple possibles in training phrases of intents of agent in DialogFlow.
				   User phase one of these things means user intention is ask a question.
				   Now we need to define a response(or multiple responses) if he ask a question.we define response in text response of responses of intent of agent.
				   Test-response :- OK , you want to drive $car car
follow-up intent:- what should then after this intent is triggered(this option is R.H.S of intent).
                   When we add follow-up intent it adds the Context in and Context-out.
				   Context-out(bookaticket-followup) for at which we click at add follow-up intent  and Context-in(bookaticket-followup) for follow-up intent
Contexts        :- Context-in  :- For what intent user is talking
                   Context-out :- 
				   If input context is songs which matches to output context of previous intent.So then we can identify user is talking about previous intent
				   e.g  intent :- songs
				           context-out :- songs
				        intent :- play it songs  
				           context-in :- songs   (Here we can identify user is talking about songs intent)
Entities        :- 1 )  System-defined Entities e.g :- London,next-week
                   Chatbot understands destination is "London" and travel "next-week".Here London and next-week is entity.
                   In this case we use action and parameters in Intents.
				   In action :- 1) Parameter name :- city , Entity :- @sys.geo.city(System define entity) , Value :- $city
				                2) Parameter name :- date , Entity :- @sys.date.period(System define entity) , Value :- $date
				   Required option :- For mandatory , if user not ask then chatbot ask needs (We add a message in "prompt" option)
				   
				   2)  Custom-defined Entities(:- e.g Paris)and Templates :- In Training Phrase (I want to drive @car:car)  @car is Custom-defined Entitiy
				   Create entity :- e.g car    after that , enter reference vale and synonym(multiple names)
Training        :- Sometimes chatbot fails to understand.In this section we train our chatbot means if next time same question ask chatbot will understand and 
                   it will answer it correctly.
