demo on Service Virtulization on 15/12/2021

Some concerns we've here:-
update from team.

In helm we have to create pod for this mountebank
instead of imposters.json, we've to kept imposters .yml file ...... otherwise we've to find a tool which converts json to yml
variableEnabled we've to update based on the any api hit or database , or otherwise we have to everytime raise the ticket to devops guy , they will enable or disable
	for any configuration, need to raise a ticket to devops guy
	Circuit breaker, we can't implement here bcz we don't want in production
	But in datatbase , we refresh the data after every 5 minutes .... so db is not valid here
	Rather of focus on flag in applicaton.yml, we should only focus on url change in aws.
	It will not accept in production, bca we r just mocking the data for testing.

SingleHostName :- If we'll change to either mountebank or actual , it will reflect all the api e.g eisl , eisl all api's will call mountebank
					in AWS , we'll not maintain flag , directly change the property value.(But flag option is also best in AWS)
					First clean code in application.yml, then extensive testing also need here.	
Two Scanories :-
1)We can create the success mock api response
	SingleHostName :- It is not valid bcz it will negate the other scanories, 
			So we need multi hostname based on that we can test particular api e.g research means here we can change all of them or one.
2)We can test system unavalibility response of all Data Processors
	SingleHostName :- Best
	
Devops guy only will change the time of the sprint means after every two weeks or whenever we'll say then also they can change.
	i think at a time of restart server means any time or we need session with devops team.
	or based on ticket generate to devops, we'll have a SLA , it can take 2-3 days bcz it is dev. independent of deployment.
	
Value derived from the system parameter  defined in the AWS.
	e.g uri : ${Research_Api_url : https://eisl-int-wmap-brd.com/api/cd/v1}
	
http  :- 
https :- It expecting cert(certificate) and key  ... our BRD r working for AWS, not for kubernetes
		 Communication between two pods(Business Rule Service and Mountebank) in AWS , is it possible with the help of http?
		 We can call the one service to another via internal pod ...(he created http bcz we guys r using http)
		 Through communication b/w service via internal pods if not accessible by out of server then http is also fine.

brainstorm :- hold a group discussion to produce ideas or a spontaneous group discussion to produce ideas and ways of solving problems.
for time being :- for time being we used this but in future we'll not use.
handover :- handover the script to dev team once done.
What exactly it is i just wanted to know.

for kubernetes :- they rusing helm scripts            ...... nazar koza(Platform Team)
for dev        :- they r using terraform scripts      ......           (Devops Team)

Envirionments :- 
	1)SBX :- Sandbox(for devops guys)
	2)Dev .... Int .... (QA...UAT..... FAT(Performance testing) ..... Prod) higher environments
	
Jenkins please retry a build   // for triggering the build
Model :- In Business_Rule_Service
Fact :- In vaildation-rules

separate instance for namespace or  should be deploy one instance per kubernetes like kafka??
We deploy kafka only in operations namespace  ..... all the services connected to one instance of kafka.

ExternalNodePorts should be static bcz before deployment we should know this ..... at run time dynamic node ports r generated

We can use Config_map on kubernetes side

we told our requiremnts

1) regarding nodeport bcz now it is creating at run time but we need static means before deployment we should have
2) some more points we've discussed nd he will also try like that he told ...... may be today we'll connect again
