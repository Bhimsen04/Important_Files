Test Double :- It is a generic term for any case where we replace a production object for testing purposes.

It allows developers to create mutiple endpoints with special condition so that they can mock the real api calls to the test application.

Some concepts we need to know in MB

1)Imposters :-  It is the most integral part of MB. It is the mock server.
				MB allows to create imposters and those imposters contains server information , i.e protocol and port number. 
2)Predicate :-  It is the part of the Imposter which determines if a request should be responded by said imposter. 
				It is moreover if else condition.
				If the request doesnâ€™t match any of the stubs defined, mountebank returns a default response
				There r different types of predicates 
				1) Equals 
				2) DeepEquals
				3) Contains
				4) Starts/EndsWith
				5) Matches
				6) Exists
				7) Not/And/Or
				
3) Proxy :- record and replay proxies   .. .. proxy mode  ...... 
			The response is generated by proxying the request to a different server

proxyOnce -     Ensures that the same request (defined by the predicates) is never proxied twice. 
				  mountebank only records one response for each request, and automatically replays that response the next time the request predicates match.
proxyAlways -   All calls will be proxied, allowing multiple responses to be saved for the same logical request. 
				  You have to explicitly tell mountebank to replay those responses.
proxyTransparent - All calls will be proxied, but will not be recorded.
