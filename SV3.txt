EC2 based kubernate environmnet in AWS
db-init-service 

Hi team,  Today is second demo on service virtulization , in first demo we've seen what is service virtulization and what prerequisite needs to use
mountebank. But in first demo we had some queries so today i'll try to overcome those queries.
we thought we will call the actual api as usaual and if any kind of exception comes then we can call there fallback method , that time mountebank 
comes into picture where we can get the customize response from the mountebank, so now i am going to show customize response after some validations.

i've considered dashboard api so whatever response we're getting here based on request , same also we're able to get from mountebank nd now 
woking on implement mounte bank in business rule service.

63586


so this week our motive is call mountebank from the any dataprocessor then deploy in the higher environmnets.



In production , we always through the errors not the mock response so do the confogurations based on environment
if the code is not working then we've to fix the code means not return the mock response
we can use there if something is pending from BA , send the mock response in terms of swagger file or something 
It is moreover stubbing the actula service
we can toggle the switch -> all or some my services will be stbbed , even that can remain in the production code , toggle will not work in the production code

I have to design it carefully so that it can be toggle , either the real api called or stub getting called , both cannot happen at the same time , 
that toggling should be through external switch , it should be environmnet configurable.

Don't think in terms of making the call to real api , if fails i will call mb , that is not purpose of stub , that would be done by a circuit breaker ,
so this is not a circuit breaker.

I'll need to come up with the design or approach which will take external flag , which will cinfigure at the environmnet level , and depending on that flag ,
we'll either make call to stub or call to the real api. It may be useful , because even it is not for all api's .... for some of the api's like MFRS , LRS , GBI
totally external they may be down , it might be helpful in those cases

Next Meeting Agenda's approach :- 
	How we can toggle it , we have to make call to both the api's either one or the other api at run time , preferably w/o restart the server
	But for that i can use database column as well , if i need ,
